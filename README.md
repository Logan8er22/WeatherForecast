# Weather Service App

The purpose of this application is to implement the service of Angular's $http and
obtain a JSON response from the service in order to recreate data strings from 
Weather Underground using the DarkSky API as well as reading cities from a file. 

The API accounts used in this app are:
* Google Maps API
* Weather Underground API
* DarkSky API

[Skycons](https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/) were used as the animated weather 
glyphs.
